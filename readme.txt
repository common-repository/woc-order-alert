Get notification with customized sound on speaker instantly when your store receive an order.

This order listener plugin will make things awesome for WooCommerce store admin. The listener will check for new orders and play music in your computer browser or in any device automatically as soon as the store receive an order. You don't need to refresh all the time to check for order. Everything will happen automatically, you just need to enable the listener once. This will definitely save lots of time and management for order processing and increase customer experience.

Admin can add some conditions/rules to check special orders. Like - Minimum order amount, Check for special product etc.
